Changes from 0.8 to 0.9 - released 2011/7/8

*General:

- Add a new parameter to the Options that can be defined per-remote-server: responseType
  This allows to force parsing received response as a given content-type instead of obeying
  the Content-type header of the response. Useful eg. for calls to Flickr

- Add sample client configurations for calling Flickr and Last.fm services

- When both DebugOutput and DevelopmentMode are enabled, the webservice calls made by ggeZWebservicesClient
  are sent to the standard eZ Publish error logs, to ease debugging

*Bugfixes:

- Debugger: fix incompatibility with eZP 4.5 and later
- Debugger: allow ssl options to be set when using soap and wsdl in plain http modes (as wsdl might be http but service https)

*Incompatible changes
