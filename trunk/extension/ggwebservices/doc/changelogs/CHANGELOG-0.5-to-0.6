Changes from 0.5 to 0.6 - released 2010/xx/yy

*Incompatible changes

- Shuffled around all design elements used by the debugger, to make it more
  consistent with eZ Publish standard practices

*General:

- Added more sample php files, in doc/samples
- Two out of three debugger views now use templates for rendering
- The debugger automatically loads session cookies when clicking in the left col
  manu to invoke the webservices on the local server, making its usage much more
  streamlined

*Bugfixes:

- Debugger is now available in every design, not only admin
- Make sure debugger views are not accessible directly even when rewrite rules
  are not active
