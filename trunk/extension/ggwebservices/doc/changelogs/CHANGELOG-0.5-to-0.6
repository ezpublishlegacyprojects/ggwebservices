Changes from 0.5 to 0.6 - released 2010/xx/yy

*Incompatible changes

- Shuffled around all design elements used by the debugger, to make it more
  consistent with eZ Publish standard practices

- the REST client now puts parameters in the query string by default, no more in
  the request body (which was wrong since it sent GET requests anyway)

*General:

- The debugger now supports debugging ezjscore methods
- A new ezjscore webservice is provided: system::listMethods. Syntax and results
  are the same as the homonymous standard method in xmlrpc!
- A new ezjscore webservice is provided: system::methodHelp. Syntax and results
  are the same as the homonymous standard method in xmlrpc
- The debugger automatically loads session cookies when clicking in the left col
  menu to invoke the webservices on the local server, making its usage much more
  streamlined
- Add support for soap 1.2 besides soap 1.1 (the standard) in the soap client
- Added more sample php files, in doc/samples
- add a __tostring method to class ggWebservicesFault to allow debugging of
  error responses when the code is invoked via ezjscore with no specific
  content-type header in the request
- Two out of three debugger views now use templates for rendering

*Bugfixes:

- Debugger is now available in every design, not only admin
- Make sure debugger views are not accessible directly even when rewrite rules
  are not active
- Fix php error generated when there is an introspection request with bad params
  sent by the user (invalid method name)
