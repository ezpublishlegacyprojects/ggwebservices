Changes from 0.5 to 0.6 - released 2010/12/XX

*Incompatible changes

- Shuffled around all design elements used by the debugger, to make it more
  consistent with eZ Publish standard practices

- the REST client now puts parameters in the query string by default, no more in
  the request body (which was wrong since it sent GET requests anyway).
  The method name is appended to the PATH part of the url.
  This can be customized using the Options parameter in wsproviders.ini.

*General:

- A 4th, optional parameter has been added to the fetch function webservices/call.
  It allowsto specify an array of options to tweak the behaviour of the client,
  basically overriding the options defines in wsproviders.ini
- The debugger now supports debugging ezjscore methods
- A new ezjscore webservice is provided: system::listMethods. Syntax and results
  are the same as the homonymous standard method in xmlrpc!
- A new ezjscore webservice is provided: system::methodHelp. Syntax and results
  are the same as the homonymous standard method in xmlrpc
- The debugger automatically loads session cookies when clicking in the left col
  menu to invoke the webservices on the local server, making its usage much more
  streamlined
- Add support for soap 1.2 besides soap 1.1 (the standard) in the phpsoap client
- Support receiving compressed http responses if zlib is installed (or curl has
  zlib compiled in)
- Support receiving compressed http requests if zlib is installed
- Support sending compressed http requests if zlib is installed
- Support Digest and NTLM auth schemes in client
- Added a REST server.
  It is considered in beta status, and might be subject to change in the future.
  It currently only supports receiving method name as last part of path in the url,
  and parameters using the query string / request body. It returns output serialized
   according to the 'Accept' http header in response (if found) or to GET parameter
   'ContentType'
- Use minified version of YUI libs for visual editor in debugger, unless in DevelopmentMode
- Added more sample php files, in doc/samples
- add a __tostring method to class ggWebservicesFault to allow debugging of
  error responses when the code is invoked via ezjscore with no specific
  content-type header in the request
- Two out of three debugger views now use templates for rendering
- A major refacoring of client, request and response php classes has taken place.
  This means it will be much easier to add clients that use GET for requests, as
  well as adding support for advanced http features.
  The utmost care has been taken not to break BC, but if you have subclassed any
  of the client, request or response classes in your own php code, you will need
  to merge the changes.
  Some classes and some methods are considered deprecated and will be removed in
  future releases (they are marked as such in the javadoc comments).
  A few new methods have been added.
  For response classes, the RawRequest memeber has been removed. Use the
  responsepayload() method of the client object instead.

*Bugfixes:

- Debugger is now available in every design, not only admin
- Make sure debugger views are not accessible directly even when rewrite rules
  are not active
- Fix php error generated when there is an introspection request with bad params
  sent by the user (invalid method name)
- Sending of username/password now works for ggezwebservicesclient (basic auth)
- More descriptive error messages when receiving bad responses from servers
- adding parameters to xmlrpc requests via addParameter() would result in unexpected
  xmlrpc calls. Now both xmlrpc and jsonrpc clients only take positional params
  (i.e. the 1st param in calls to addParameter($name, $val) will be ignored)
