Changes from 0.9.1 to 0.10 - released 2011/10/xx

*General:

- client now accepts all 20x http reponse codes, to make it more REST compliant
- REST client can now send requests with a body encodes as json (or php) instead of urlencoding it
- REST support available in the debugger

*Bugfixes:

- complex results from SOAP services would net be usable in template code when using ggPhpSOAPClient

*Incompatible changes

- ggPhpSOAPClient::send() now returns php arrays instead of StdClass objects.
  This makes its behaviour the same as the one of ggSOAPClient::send(), and makes
  it easy to use it in template code.
  To turn this behaviour off for a specific server, set "Options[returnArrays]=0" for it in wsproviders.ini
- method ggeZWebservicesClient::send is deprecated and will be removed at some point in the future
