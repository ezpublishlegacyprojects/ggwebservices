Changes from 0.9.1 to 0.10 - released 2011/10/30

*General:

- client now accepts all 20x http reponse codes, to make it more REST compliant
- REST client can now send requests with a body encodes as json (or php) instead of urlencoding it
- REST support available in the debugger

*Bugfixes:

- results from some SOAP services would not be usable in template code when using ggPhpSOAPClient
- results serialized as XML would not be usable in template code when using ggRESTClient

*Incompatible changes

- when querying REST services that return XML data, an object of class ggSimpleTemplateXML
  is returned instead of one of class SimpleXML.
  This has the advantage of being usable in template code, the former was not.
  If you prefer to work with the SimpleXML, just call $value->toSimpleXML().

- ggPhpSOAPClient::send() now returns php arrays instead of StdClass objects.
  This makes its behaviour the same as the one of ggSOAPClient::send(), and makes
  it easy to use it in template code.
  To turn this behaviour off for a specific server, set "Options[returnArrays]=0" for it
  either in wsproviders.ini or in the $options argument in the ggeZWebservicesClient::call method call

- method ggeZWebservicesClient::send is deprecated and will be removed at some point in the future
