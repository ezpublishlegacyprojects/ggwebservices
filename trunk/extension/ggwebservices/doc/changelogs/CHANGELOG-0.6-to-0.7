Changes from 0.6 to 0.7 - released 2011/xx/yy

*Incompatible changes

- the protected variable $Cookies is not populated in the client automatically with cookies received by the server
- the debugger does not allow anymore to enter plaintext for the webservice payload (request body)
- the client defaults to checking SSL peer certificate (but this can be disabled via a setOpt call)

*General:

- Add support for limiting access to webservices by client's IP address
- Add support for setting cookies in the client
- Add support for setting ssl options in the client
- The debugger now can debug SOAP services
- The debugger uses now the same php classes as the rest of the code, instead of using the phpxmlrpc library

*Bugfixes:

- Make sure debug info is reset in phpsoapclients when a call fails at the wsdl retrieval stage
- Make sure that client respects timeout when not in CURL mode (added a new error code for that case)
- Make sure that client respects timeout when in CURL mode
- Do not send an Accept-Encoding header when it's empty
- Allow usage of curl with compressed responses (do not try to inflate them twice)
- Force usage of curl when ssl transport not registered for streams
- Fix method ggWebservicesRequest::addParameters
