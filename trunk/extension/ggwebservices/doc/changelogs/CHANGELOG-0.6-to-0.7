Changes from 0.6 to 0.7 - released 2011/3/31

*General:

- Server: Add support for limiting access to webservices by client's IP address

- Client: Add support for calling ezjscore servers
- Client: Add support for setting cookies in the client
- Client: Add support for setting ssl options in the client
- Client: Allow soap client not to cache wsdl

- Debugger: The debugger now can debug SOAP services
- Debugger: The debugger uses now the same php classes as the rest of the code, instead of using the phpxmlrpc library

*Bugfixes:

- Client: Make sure debug info is reset in phpsoapclients when a call fails at the wsdl retrieval stage
- Client: Make sure that client respects timeout when not in CURL mode (added a new error code for that case)
- Client: Make sure that client respects timeout when in CURL mode
- Client: Do not send an Accept-Encoding header when it's empty
- Client: Allow usage of curl with compressed responses - do not try to inflate them twice
- Client: Force usage of curl when ssl transport not registered for streams
- Client: Fix method ggWebservicesRequest::addParameters

*Incompatible changes

- the protected variable $Cookies is not populated in the client automatically with cookies received by the server
- the debugger does not allow anymore to enter plaintext for the webservice payload (request body)
- the client defaults to checking SSL peer certificate (but this can be disabled via a setOpt call)
- the phpxmlrpc library inclusion is considered DEPRECATED; the lib will be removed in some future release
