Changes from 0.4 to 0.5 - released 2010/6/21

*Incompatible changes

- the policy limitations on webservices/execute have been rewritten to actually
  work. This unfortunately means that if you used any such limitation, you will
  have to edit your user roles and recreate the limitations

*General:

- allow to register ws methods with dots in their name; will be mapped to
  underscores when looking up corresponding php functions

- add a new webservice: ezp.authandexec; it allows to authenticate and execute a
  2nd webservice in a single call. Useful e.g. for those ws clients that do not
  support cookies.
  Syntax of this new webservice:
  mixed ezp.authandexecute( string $username, string $password, string $webservicetobeexecuted, array $params )
  nb: the user account $username must have been given execution rights on $webservicetobeexecuted

- added a new policy limitation on the webservices/execute view: per siteaccess

*Bugfixes:

- the policy limitations on webservices/execute have been fixed

- the url used in the debugger when cliking on the right-col to test the local
  server was not correct when eZ Publish is not in vhost mode
