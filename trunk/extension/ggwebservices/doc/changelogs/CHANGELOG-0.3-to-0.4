Changes from 0.3 to 0.4 - released xxxx/yy/zz

*General:
- added a cronjob to rotate ws logs. By default added to infrequent set
- added support for calling external services that require simple POST (a.k.a. html forms) to the template fetch function / ggeZWebservicesClient class
- added a view to invoke webservices without the need of a specific controller file: /webesrvices/execute/$protocol (supported protocls are currently xmlrpc and jsonrpc)
- add support of exposing ezjscore webservices to xmlrpc/jsonroc calls via that view
- moved javascript libraries to 'standard' design, so that they can be used for front-end interfaces too
- upgrade the included phpxmlrpc lib to 3.0.0 beta, fixing all warnings with php 5.3

*Bugfixes:
- give a debuggable error message if soap extension is not enabled and user tries to create a ggPhpSOAPClient
- bad php contants where used by ggXMLRPCServer if invalid params where received
