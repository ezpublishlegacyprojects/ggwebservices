- test https support with and without curl, with and without proxy too

- add a soap controller based on ggphpsoap instead of ezsoap (needs a server class first)

- finish proxy module
  => add soap support. Need to create a new soap server class, too?
  => add POST/GET (rest) support. Need to create a new server class, too?
  => add fine-grained policy control with per_server_per_method limitations (this one needs server to support listMethods() call), possibly per_siteaccess?

- allow ws controllers to operate in no-session mode

- add a module view that does ws execution; time it (memory, time) vs. using jsonrpc.php

- add a new controller file capable to do multi-protocol requests
  + make it compatible with ezcore

- add optional extended logging of received ws calls and outgoing responses (use ezdebugsettings or a custom log file?)

- add phpdoc-generated api docs to the distribution

- improve input parameter type validation

- add a compatibility layer to import webservices designed for ezrest

- improve list of local servers in left menu of debugger: if per-sa servers are enabled, show one link per sa?

- move debugger to ez classes and remove the phpxmlrpc lib

- add soap and rest support to the debugger

- add a testsuite (eg. to test all the error codes after shuffling them around)

- allow extension ro run on phpxmlrpc/phpjsonrpc/nusoap if php extensions are missing

- add support for curl multi calls to execute multiple calls in parallel
