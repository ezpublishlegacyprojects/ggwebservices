- test https support with and without curl

- add support for proxies to ggeZwsclient, either from site.ini/ProxySettings or via per-server configuration (or both)

  Possibly encapsulate all http-level errors in one code (putting the details in the error msg) and separate better client-generated errors from server-generated ones

- decide what to show on left col of the debugger

- release 0.2


- finish proxy module
  => add soap support. Need to create a new soap server class, too?
  => add POST/GET (rest) support. Need to create a new server class, too?

- add a module view that does ws execution; time it (memory, time) vs. using jsonrpc.php

- add a new controller file capable to do multi-protocol requests
  + make it compatible with ezcore

- add optional extended logging of received ws calls and outgoing responses (use ezdebugsettings or a custom log file?)
