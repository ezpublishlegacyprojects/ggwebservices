- finish porting ws call from tpl op to tpl fetch func (test it)

- finish proxy module
  => add to server class a method to display a given response
  => need to create a new sopa server class, too?
  => move content-type headers generation to a server function (response class)?
  => add POST/GET (rest) support

- add a module view that does ws execution; time it (memory, time) vs. using index.php
