GG Webservices for eZ publish
========================================

Goals:

Allow to easily execute calls to remote servers using the REST, JSONRPC, XMLRPC and SOAP protocols (both from within php code and templates)
Allow to expose existing functionality as JSONRPC or XMLRPC webservices, much as it can already be done with SOAP in any eZ Publish installation
Provide a proxy module allowing javascript code served by an eZ Publish server to execute cross-domain webservice calls (without resorting to tricks)
Keep the same API as the existing eZ SOAP classes for maximum interoperability
Long term, the existing SOAP client could be replaced with a new one, based either on NuSOAP, eZSOAP, or PHP::SOAP


Prerequisites:

PHP 5 / eZP 4.0+
to execute/receive jsonrpc calls, the php JSON extension is needed
to execute/receive rest calls, the php SIMPLEXML extension is needed
to execute/receive xmlrpc calls, the php XMLRPC extension is needed


Basics:

- every webservice server that has to be accessed from eZ Publish has to be defined in wsproviders.ini
- to receive xmlrpc or jsonrpc calls, you need to:
  1 - modify the configuration in wsproviders.ini and
  2 - create a file extension/xxx/jsonrpc/initialize.php with the php code to be exposed as webservice
- to call remote webservices from within templates use ...
  please remember to desactivate the view cache where needed for templates that execute webservice calls
- to call remote webservices from php code use ggeZWebServicesClient::send( $server, $metod, $params=array() );


Modules:

- wsproxy: module used to allow javascript code in eZ Publish pages to execute cross-domain webservice calls (ie. execute calls to other servers)
- webservices: module used as a mere container for fetch functions


Template fetch functions:

- ...

Template operators:

- 'washxml', 'washxmlcomment', 'washxmlcdata': operators to be used to properly escape data in different xml contexts
- 'wsSend': operator used to execute a webservice call to an external server in templates

Php classes:

- ...
