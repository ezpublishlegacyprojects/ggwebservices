1 - activate the extension following the standard eZ Publish procedures (remember to regenerate the ezp_extension.php file)

2 - there is no fight club!

3 - to receive jsonrpc or xmlrpc webservice calls:
  + copy the files jsonrpc.php/xmlrpc.php in the eZ Publish installation root folder
  + modify the Apache rewrite rules / the .htaccess file so that they are accessible from the web
  + define the php functions you want to expose as webservices in the file "initialize.php" in either a "phpxmlrpc" or "jsonrpc" folder in the eZ Publish installation root folder

4 - to make webservice calls to external server via templates
  + define the remote servers that will be made accessible in the wsproviders.ini.append.php file
  + use the fetch( 'webservices', 'call' ) template fetch function. It takes 3 parameters: name of the remote server, name of the ws method to execute and array of ws method parameters

5 - to enable js code to call webservices on remote servers (cross domain requests):
  + give access permissions to the webservices/proxy function to the desired eZ Publish user
  + define the remote servers that will be made accessible in the wsproviders.ini.append.php file
  + the url to be called is: http://my.ez.server/index.php/siteaccess/webservices/proxy/protocol/remoteservername where protocol is either "phpxmlrpc" or "jsonrpc", and remoteservername is the name of a server defined in wsproviders.ini.append.php file
