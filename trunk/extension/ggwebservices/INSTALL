1 - activate the extension following the standard eZ Publish procedures (remember to regenerate the ezp_extension.php file)

    To use the debugger, you will have to alter by hand the autoload file, as the one generated by eZ Publish
    does not recognize php classes declared inside .inc files. Add these lines:

      'xmlrpc_client'           => 'extension/ggwebservices/lib/xmlrpc/xmlrpc.inc',
      'xmlrpcmsg'               => 'extension/ggwebservices/lib/xmlrpc/xmlrpc.inc',
      'xmlrpcresp'              => 'extension/ggwebservices/lib/xmlrpc/xmlrpc.inc',
      'xmlrpcval'               => 'extension/ggwebservices/lib/xmlrpc/xmlrpc.inc',
      'jsonrpc_client'          => 'extension/ggwebservices/lib/json/jsonrpc.inc',
      'jsonrpcmsg'              => 'extension/ggwebservices/lib/json/jsonrpc.inc',
      'jsonrpcresp'             => 'extension/ggwebservices/lib/json/jsonrpc.inc',
      'jsonrpcval'              => 'extension/ggwebservices/lib/json/jsonrpc.inc',

2 - there is no fight club!

3 - to receive jsonrpc or xmlrpc webservice calls:
  + copy the files jsonrpc.php/xmlrpc.php in the eZ Publish installation root folder
  + modify the Apache rewrite rules / the .htaccess file so that they are accessible from the web
  + define the php functions you want to expose as webservices in the file "initialize.php" in either a "phpxmlrpc" or "jsonrpc" folder in the eZ Publish installation root folder

4 - to make webservice calls to external server via templates
  + define the remote servers that will be made accessible in the wsproviders.ini.append.php file
  + use the fetch( 'webservices', 'call' ) template fetch function. It takes 3 parameters: name of the remote server, name of the ws method to execute and array of ws method parameters

5 - (NB: NOT YET WORKING) to enable js code to call webservices on remote servers (cross domain requests):
  + give access permissions to the webservices/proxy function to the desired eZ Publish user
  + define the remote servers that will be made accessible in the wsproviders.ini.append.php file
  + the url to be called is: http://my.ez.server/index.php/siteaccess/webservices/proxy/protocol/remoteservername where protocol is either "phpxmlrpc" or "jsonrpc", and remoteservername is the name of a server defined in wsproviders.ini.append.php file
